            <p class="desc">The <span class="bolded coloured2"> World Happiness Report </span> is a publication. According to the
               respondents' evaluation of their lives, it contains happiness indexes and rankings of <span class="bolded coloured">140 countries </span>. The report is also related to four (quality) life factors, namely, the contribution of GDP to the happiness index , 
            the impact of life expectancy on happiness, the impact of national freedom on the happiness index, and  the contribution of alcohol consumption to the happiness index. As of  <span class="bolded coloured">March 2022 </span>,  <span class="bolded coloured2">Finland </span> has been rated as the happiest country in the world for <span class="bolded coloured2"> 
              five consecutive times</span>.

          It can be seen from the figure that <span class="bolded coloured2"> Finland's</span> happiness index keeps the first place all
          the year round (the happiness index is <span class="bolded coloured"> 7.63 </span> to <span class="bolded coloured"> 7.82 </span>),

               From this figure, it can be seen that <span class="bolded coloured2">Germany's</span> per capita beer consumption is <span class="bolded coloured">346 </span> (happiness index is <span class="bolded coloured">6.99</span>).
