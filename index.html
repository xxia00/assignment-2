            <p class="desc">The <span class="bolded coloured2"> World Happiness Report </span> is a publication. According to the respondents' evaluation of their lives,
               it contains happiness indexes and rankings of <span class="bolded coloured">140 countries </span>. 
            The report is also related to four (quality) life factors, namely, the contribution of GDP to the happiness index , 
            the impact of life expectancy on happiness, the impact of national freedom on the happiness index, and  the contribution of alcohol consumption to the happiness index.
             As of  <span class="bolded coloured">March 2022 </span>,  <span class="bolded coloured2">Finland </span> has been rated as the happiest country in the world for <span class="bolded coloured2"> five consecutive times </span>. </p>

             The light red to dark red in the figure shows the level of happiness index. 
             It can be seen from the figure that <span class="bolded coloured2"> Finland's</span> happiness index keeps the first place all

            The <span class="bolded coloured2">radial chart </span>shows the correlation between <span class="bolded coloured2"> beer </span>and <span class="bolded coloured2"> wine </span>consumption and happiness index in <span class="bolded coloured"> 2016 </span>.
             From this figure, it can be seen that <span class="bolded coloured2">Denmark's </span>per capita beer consumption is <span class="bolded coloured">346 </span> (happiness index is <span class="bolded coloured"> 6.99 </span>). 
             On the contrary, <span class="bolded coloured2">Israel's</span> happiness index, which has only <span class="bolded coloured"> 63 </span>beer consumption per capita, is <span class="bolded coloured"> 7.27 </span>.
              Therefore, the <span class="bolded coloured2"> happiness index </span> of countries with less <span class="bolded coloured2">beer </span> consumption per capita is on the high side.

          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand,<span class="bolded coloured2"> Switzerland's </span>per capita wine consumption is <span class="bolded coloured">280 </span>(happiness index is <span class="bolded coloured">7.51 </span>),

            Therefore, it can be concluded that the<span class="bolded coloured2"> happiness index </span> of countries with high per capita<span class="bolded coloured2"> wine </span>consumption is on the high side.

            From this figure, it can be seen that <span class="bolded coloured2">Finland's</span> life expectancy is <span class="bolded coloured">72</span> (happiness index is <span class="bolded coloured">7.84 </span>),

            The trend of <span class="bolded coloured2">scatterplot </span> is inclined upward.
             Therefore, it can be concluded that <span class="bolded coloured2">life expectancy </span> is in direct proportion to the <span class="bolded coloured2">happiness index </span>.
